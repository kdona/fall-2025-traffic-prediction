    "## Goals\n",
    "1. Filter events (accidents and roadwork): keep only those on I-10 between Loop 202 and I-17 (Broadway Curve area)\n",
    "2. Filter INRIX data based on time range and I-10 location\n",
    "3. Export filtered data for training\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note on TMC Mapping\n",
    "Unlike SR60 data, the I-10 CSV does not have a separate TMC_Identification.csv file with lat/lon coordinates.\n",
    "Therefore, we'll use a simplified approach:\n",
    "- Filter INRIX data by time range only\n",
    "- Use events lat/lon directly for spatial analysis\n",
    "- For event-to-TMC matching, we'll assign events to TMC segments based on manual inspection or use all I-10 TMCs in the area"

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook successfully:\n",
    "1. ✅ Filtered AZ511 events to I-10 Broadway Curve area (438 events from 2025-06-13 to 2025-11-09)\n",
    "2. ✅ Loaded INRIX traffic data for the overlap period (2025-06-13 to 2025-09-23)\n",
    "3. ✅ Created simplified TMC assignments (without coordinate data)\n",
    "4. ✅ Exported data for the training pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Coverage:\n",
    "- **Events**: 438 events (362 accidents, 60 roadwork, 16 closures)\n",
    "- **Time Range**: June 13, 2025 - September 23, 2025 (overlap of event and INRIX data)\n",
    "- **Location**: I-10 Broadway Curve (between Loop 202 and I-17)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations:\n",
    "- TMC assignments are approximate due to missing coordinate data\n",
    "- Spatial matching between events and TMC segments is simplified\n",
    "- Events after 2025-09-23 cannot be matched (INRIX data ends there)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations:\n",
    "1. Obtain TMC_Identification.csv for I-10 with lat/lon coordinates\n",
    "2. Implement proper distance-based TMC matching (as attempted in original notebook)\n",
    "3. Consider using INRIX XD segment IDs if available from INRIX API\n",
    "4. Acquire INRIX data beyond 2025-09-23 to cover all events"
